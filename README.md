# Geometric Animated 404 Page

A minimal black & white geometric 404 page with animated line–shaping effect.  
The "404" outline and internal fill-lines animate in a continuous 4-second loop, creating a technical / abstract construction-style look.

This page is intended for use as:

- 404 error page  
- "Page in progress" screen  
- Section under construction placeholder  

---

## Design Style

- Black & white only  
- Geometric background grid  
- Animated geometric structures  
- 404 outline draws and resets in a loop  
- Internal lines animate as if the page is being built  
- Clean typography (Space Grotesk)

Animation cycle duration: **4 seconds**
